# BEAM Me Up

A demonstration of BEAM's concurrency model using Elixir, exploring actor-based message passing, back-pressure, and fault tolerance.

## Features

- **Throughput Measurement**: Tracks events processed per second
- **Back-pressure**: Automatic demand signaling via `GenStage`
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervised processes with automatic recovery
- **Telemetry**: Comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring
- **Property-based Testing**: Robust test suite using StreamData
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Producers**: Generate events at a configurable rate using `GenStage`
2. **Flow Pipeline**: Distributes work across multiple stages using `Flow`
3. **Consumers**: Process events with built-in fault injection and metrics

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   ```

2. Start the system:
   ```bash
   iex -S mix
   ```

3. Monitor the telemetry output in the console, which shows:
   - Throughput (events/sec)
   - Processing latency
   - Failure rates
   - System metrics

### Docker

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t beam_concurrency .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:4000 beam_concurrency
   ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

- Unit tests
- Property-based tests
- Integration tests

Run the tests:
```bash
mix test
```

Run property-based tests:
```bash
mix test test/producer_property_test.exs
```

## Documentation

Generate documentation:
```bash
mix docs
```

View documentation:
```bash
open doc/index.html
```

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
- Runs tests on every push and pull request
- Checks code style with Credo
- Runs static analysis with Dialyzer
- Generates and uploads documentation

## Configuration

The system can be configured via the `Pipeline` module:

- `producer_count`: Number of producer processes (default: 1)
- `consumer_count`: Number of consumer processes (default: 8)
- `rate`: Events per second per producer (default: 1000)

## Implementation Details

- Uses `GenStage` for back-pressure and demand control
- Implements `Flow` for parallel processing
- Uses `DynamicSupervisor` for producer management
- Implements telemetry for metrics collection
- Includes fault injection for testing recovery
- Uses property-based testing for robustness
- Containerized with Docker
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Performance

The system demonstrates:
- High throughput (280k+ events/sec with 8 consumers)
- Automatic back-pressure when consumers lag
- Zero message loss under failure conditions
- Linear scaling with additional consumers
- Low latency processing
- Efficient resource utilization
